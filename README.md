## Description

If you are botanist,plants collerctor or grower enthusiast, your mobile phone and computer are almost certainly full of thousands of photos of plants. This is understandable, because you take photos not only in special moments in plants life like flowering, but also just regulary, to track the development of the plant. And all attempts to organize this bunch of photos are usual unsuccessful. 

The other laborious task is to keep information about plants. Plastic labels with basic information and excel-file (or barn notebook) are traditional tools. Maintaining of such accounting system requires a lot of work and has high risks of human factor mistakes.

Automatically recognizible labels can help to solve both of this tasks. [Data Matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Matrix) is like QR-Code, but smaller and containts just a unique number of plant. Label with Data Matrix is easy to DIY - print, cut and laminate for all plants at once. The benefits of such labels: 
- plant on the photo can be automatically recognized;
- automatically put information about the plant (name, age, seed source, etc.) in the bottom of the photo;
- automatically move photo to the folder of particular plant.
